# Shared APIs

These APIs work **identically** on both Server and Client.

    Delayed and repeating callbacks

  <Card title="Math Types" href="/docs/scripting/shared/math">
    Vec3, Quat, Rotator, Color
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Why Shared?

These APIs have the exact same behavior on both sides:

- **Timer** - `Timer.Delay`, `Timer.Interval`, `Timer.Clear` work the same
- **Math Types** - `Vec3`, `Quat`, `Rotator`, `Color` are identical

Other APIs like `Player`, `Events`, and `Entities` have **different capabilities** on server vs client, so they have separate documentation pages.
