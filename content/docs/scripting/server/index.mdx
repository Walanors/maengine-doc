## Server Authority

The server is authoritative for all game state:

- **Entity spawning** - Only the server can create entities
- **State modification** - Server validates and applies all changes
- **Database access** - Only server has DB access
- **Player management** - Kick, ban, possess operations

```lua
-- Server/init.lua
Server.Subscribe("Start", function()
    Log("Server started!")
end)

Player.Subscribe("Spawn", function(player)
    local character = Character.Spawn(Vec3(0, 0, 100))
    player:Possess(character)
end)
```
