# Widget

<Callout type="info">
  **Status: Coming Soon** - Native Widget support is planned for a future release.
</Callout>

**Availability:** Client Only

The Widget system will provide access to Unreal's native UMG (Unreal Motion Graphics) widgets with Lua bindings and Store integration.

---

## Planned Features

### Native UMG Widgets

Create and manipulate native Unreal widgets from Lua:

```lua
-- Planned API (subject to change)
local button = Widget.Create("Button")
button:SetText("Click Me")
button:SetPosition(100, 100)
button:SetSize(200, 50)

button:On("Clicked", function()
    Log("Button was clicked!")
end)
```

---

### Store Integration

Widgets will integrate with Store for reactive data binding:

```lua
-- Planned API (subject to change)
local healthBar = Widget.Create("ProgressBar")
healthBar:BindStore("player.health", function(value)
    return value / 100  -- Progress bars use 0-1 range
end)
```

---

### Blueprint Widget Support

Load and interact with Blueprint-designed widgets:

```lua
-- Planned API (subject to change)
local inventory = Widget.LoadBlueprint("WBP_Inventory")
inventory:Show()

-- Access named widgets from Blueprint
local slotGrid = inventory:GetWidget("SlotGrid")
slotGrid:SetSlots(playerInventory)
```

---

## Use Cases

- **Native Performance** - UMG widgets render at native speed
- **Designer Workflow** - Artists can design UIs in UMG Editor
- **Complex Widgets** - Rich components like ScrollBox, TreeView, ListView
- **Platform Features** - Virtual keyboard, focus navigation, accessibility
